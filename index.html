            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>In 2018 my wife and I took a tour of Iceland for our honeymoon. Whereas most would choose to honeymoon on a beach, we decided to cross off an item on our bucket list and set off for Iceland in search of the majestic Aurora Borealis.</p>
            <p>Iceland is one of the most interesting and beautiful places we have visited, due to its diversity of volcanoes and glaciers, it truly is the land of Fire and Ice.</p>
            <p>I’ve written this blog to share our experiences, with the hope it will inspire you to visit Iceland and experience these wonders for yourself.</p>

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>Our travel company recommended visiting Iceland during November for the best chances of seeing the Aurora Borealis. So, as first-time visitors to the country, we prepared for what we thought would be a winter wonderland. As we found out, this isn’t actually the case. Although Iceland just touches the Arctic Circle, the island is situated in the path of the warmer air of the Jet Stream and has similar weather patterns to the UK. This being said, a thermal underlayer and a warm coat is recommended clothing for that time of the year due to the bitter (and surprisingly strong) winds coming in off the North Sea. </p>
            <p>There are very few inhabitants of Iceland, only around 357,000 people live there and a large percentage live in the island’s capital city Reykjavik. This is because the centre of the island is pretty much uninhabitable due to volcanoes, glaciers, geysers and hot springs. The remainder of the inhabitants live around the coastline. For these reasons there is one main ring road (or Route 1) around the island, which poses a problem if there’s an accident or if a bridge is taken out by flood water from a glacier as the detour would take a day to complete. If you wish to drive the route, most people recommend taking 8 to 10 days to complete it to take in all the sights.</p>

            <h2>Icelandic Heritage</h2>
            <p>In many places you travel to in Iceland the history of the Icelandic people is very apparent and well preserved. You can see evidence of their Viking heritage in turf covered structures. These structures were built by Nordic settlers due to the massive deforestation of the island and lack of other building materials. The turf, however, is an excellent insulator and helped the settlers survive Iceland’s harsh climate. Looking around inside you’ll find the beds are extremely small, this wasn’t because Icelandic settlers were short, it was because they slept in a sitting position. Our tour guid told us it was because they believed they would die if they slept laying down but this is just a theory.</p>
            <P>There are many museums to visit where you can learn more about the history and folklore of the island, from Vikings to Trolls and Elves. More information can be found <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g189952-Activities-c49-Iceland.html " target="_blank">here.</a></P>
